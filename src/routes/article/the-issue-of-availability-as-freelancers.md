# The Issue of Availability

Freelancers and contract workers of various expertise struggle with availability in today's age of instantaneous communication. Even full-time employees are sometimes expected to be ready beyond their agreed-upon working hours. Whilst this is understandable in industries such as cybersecurity and emergency response, where human lives are at stake, it is often counter-productive and even harmful to expect constant readiness from workers in other fields. 

## My limited experience

Being a freelance graphic designer on-and-off for the past year has allowed me ease of mind with regards to having to follow a schedule or routine. This has its own pros and cons, but for the most part I am grateful to be able to get enough sleep without having to go to bed early, and being able to bring my laptop with me to work wherever I am comfortable at. This comes at the cost of a lesser degree of stability income-wise, but this is a debate for another day.


There have been multiple occasions where the pressure of replying to text messages and inquiries for meetings have caused me to feel stressed and less eager to work.  Sometimes these are necessary to get things done, but other times not muchâ€”such as when my client wants me to attend a call where they ask me to 'try changing things just to see how it looks' multiple times and then reverting back to the beginning. Due to the uncertainty of when I would need to be available, I would often find myself judging a quiet Telegram work group chat in the morning to be a sign of a quiet day, only to have my phone vibrate with messages expressing urgency at 2PM whilst I am at a burger place with my friends on a Sunday.

## What can be done

As freelancers, it is our responsibility to take into consideration availability and agreeing upon office hours before sending out our contracts.

Employers and clients, on the other hand, need to take into consideration the unwanted side-effects of the stress a person can experience from the pressure of being expected to be constantly ready for work. The freelance developer coding your company's website, the graphic designer re-branding your company, or anyone involved in a project with you will be less productive, less creative, and will come to the conclusion of judging their working experience as being unpleasant.
